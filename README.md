# arduino_watch
Arduino Uno/Duemilanove + Tiny RTC DS1307 + Adafruit 128x32 I2C OLED

Creating a simple watch consisting of an arduino duemilanove board, a small oled display and a real time clock breakout, all connected via I2C.
To get the code to work, first die Adafruit-GFX-Library and the Adafruit_SSD1306 driver library for monochrome displays is
needed. 

Tested under Arduino 1.6.2 SDK.
